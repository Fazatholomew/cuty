## 🙏 Motivation

I created Cuty.ink because I was tired of seeing ugly, long links in my posts and messages. When I shared [a post in LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7013110254343266304/) about a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lNBW4_gjA8fWj9Sqg5-g3NnyYS-1xwsT?usp=sharing), the post looked cluttered and unappealing. I wanted a way to customize the thumbnail and appearance of my links, and that's where Cuty.ink comes in. I hope it can serve you well how it does to me.

💖 Thank you for using Cuty.ink!
